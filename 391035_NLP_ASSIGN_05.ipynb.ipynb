By examining processes such as addition (affixation) and deletion (clipping, backformation), we aim to understand how these morphological operations contribute to word formation across different languages. This investigation will enhance our comprehension of linguistic structure, enabling a deeper appreciation of how meaning is systematically encoded in words. Additionally, this study seeks to highlight the significance of morphology in fields such as language acquisition, computational linguistics, and natural language processing"
